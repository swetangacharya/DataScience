**PCA  (Principal Component Analysis)**
is a method to linearly transform a domain into a co-domain whose basis vectors are orthogonal. This transformation is
often considered for dimensionality reduction via feature selection, for studying the
data variance along reference axes, as well as for analyzing data subspaces.
